# Welcome to C# Programming

## What is C#?

C# (pronounced "C-Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's part of the .NET ecosystem and is used to build:

- **Desktop Applications** (Windows Forms, WPF)
- **Web Applications** (ASP.NET Core)
- **Mobile Apps** (Xamarin, .NET MAUI)
- **Games** (Unity)
- **Cloud Applications** (Azure)

## Why Learn C#?

✅ **Easy to Learn**: C# has a clean, readable syntax
✅ **Versatile**: Build almost any type of application
✅ **Strong Community**: Huge ecosystem and support
✅ **Career Opportunities**: High demand in the job market
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Your First C# Program

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C# programming!");
    }
}
```

**What this code does:**
- `using System;` - Imports the System namespace
- `class Program` - Defines a class named Program
- `static void Main()` - The entry point of every C# program
- `Console.WriteLine()` - Prints text to the console

## Key Concepts to Remember

1. **Case Sensitive**: `Main` is different from `main`
2. **Semicolons**: Every statement ends with `;`
3. **Curly Braces**: `{}` group code blocks together
4. **Comments**: Use `//` for single line or `/* */` for multi-line
