# .NET Tutor â€” Learn .NET with My .NET app

---

## ðŸš€ MVP (First Release Goals)

The **.NET Tutor App** is a learning tool built with **.NET** (backend) and **React + TypeScript** (frontend).  
It presents structured, interactive content inspired by the official .NET documentation, with the goal of deepening my understanding of the .NET Framework.

**The MVP will include:**

1. **Side Navigation Bar**  
   - Persistent left-hand side nav with at least **6 clickable tabs**, e.g.:  
     1. Introduction to .NET  
     2. C# Basics  
     3. ASP.NET Core Overview  
     4. Entity Framework Core  
     5. .NET Libraries & Tools  
     6. Advanced Topics  

2. **Content Display**  
   - Each tab loads a dedicated page with text, code snippets, and examples.  
   - Syntax highlighting for code samples.  

3. **Basic User Authentication**  
   - Sign up, log in, and log out with email/password.  
   - JWT or cookie-based authentication.  

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.  

5. **Basic Search Functionality**  
   - Search bar to find topics or keywords within the tutorial content.  

6. **Error & Loading States**  
   - Graceful error handling for missing content or API failures.  
   - Loading spinners/placeholders while fetching data.  

7. **AWS Deployment**  
   - Publicly accessible deployment on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or Amplify).  
   - Basic CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.  

8. **Stripe Integration**  
   - Basic payment flow for unlocking premium content.  
   - Test mode enabled during development.
