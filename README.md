     5. .NET Libraries & Tools
     6. Advanced Topics

- ✅ **Interactive Content Display**
   - Each tab loads a dedicated page with text, code snippets, and examples.
   - Syntax highlighting for code samples.

- ✅ **Responsive Design**
   - Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.

- ✅ **Basic Search Functionality**
   - Search bar to find topics or keywords within the tutorial content.
